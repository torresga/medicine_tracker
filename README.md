Riff off of the Medicine Dose Tracker project idea and user stories found here:

https://www.codementor.io/projects/medicine-dose-tracker-b6evlas194
(but constrained to a particular type of medicine ;))

Todo:
- unit tests for Strain model
- integration testing for both controllers
- add validations for the Strain model
- add columns for cannabinoids and terpenes
- Expand the notes field into its' own model... my vision for this is to expand it into more of a note keeping app.
- Add Devise for a proper authentication system
